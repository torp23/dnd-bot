# CLAUDE.md — DnD Bot Project Context

## What This Is

A Discord bot that acts as an AI Dungeon Master for D&D 5e campaigns. It listens to players in a voice channel via speech-to-text, sends their input to Google Gemini, and speaks the DM's response back into voice using TTS. It enforces character constraints (spell lists, spell slots, class features, action economy) by injecting a full player capabilities block into every Gemini prompt.

## Architecture Notes

- **State**: `GameState` is a dataclass saved as JSON per campaign under `campaigns/`. `DMCog` holds the active `GameState` instance (`self.state`). `CharacterCog` accesses it via `bot.cogs.get("DMCog").state`.
- **Gemini**: Every call to `get_dm_response()` injects a full game state + player capabilities block. `world_notes` (including Human DM notes and campaign backstory) are included in this block.
- **Voice pipeline**: `discord-ext-voice-recv` captures PCM per player → RMS silence detection cuts utterances → Google Cloud STT → Gemini → gTTS → FFmpegOpusAudio. An asyncio lock queues TTS playback so responses don't overlap.
- **Fallback**: If the bot isn't in voice, DM responses post as a Discord embed in the log channel.
- **Campaigns**: Multiple campaigns can be saved. Only one is active at a time. `!startcampaign` lets you switch between them.

## Features Built

### Campaign Management
- `!newcampaign` — 4-step guided setup: campaign name → starting location → backstory → Human DM assignment. Pauses and saves any active campaign first.
- `!startcampaign` — Lists saved campaigns with session number, player count, location, last played. Pick by number, type `new`, or `cancel`.
- `!stopcampaign` — Saves state, increments session counter, clears conversation history (world notes kept), DMs each player their full character sheet.

### Human DM (most recently added)
- A designated Human DM can privately message the bot to inject context and plot points that only the AI DM sees (stored in `world_notes` as `[Human DM] <note>`).
- Assigned during `!newcampaign` setup (step 4) via @mention or `skip`.
- `!humanDM` — shows who the current Human DM is.
- `!updateDM` — reassign or remove the Human DM.
- Human DM is stored on `GameState` as `human_dm_id` (int) and `human_dm_name` (str).

### Campaign Backstory
- Step 3 of `!newcampaign` prompts for free-form backstory (2-minute timeout). Saved to `world_notes` as `"Campaign Backstory:\n..."`. Useful for groups continuing a manual campaign with the bot.

### Character Registration
- `!register <dndbeyond_url>` — imports name, race, class, level, HP, spells, slots, and class features from D&D Beyond (sheet must be public).
- `!register <name> <race> <class>` — manual entry.
- Re-running `!register` with a D&D Beyond URL auto-detects level changes and fires the level-up announcement.

### Character Tracking (CharacterCog)
- `!hp set/damage/heal/show`
- `!inventory show/add/remove`
- `!spell add/remove/show/cast` — cast consumes the appropriate slot; cantrips are free.
- `!slot set/use/restore/show` — visual bar display.
- `!feature add/use/restore/show` — tracks recharge type (short/long/none).
- `!action use/reset/show` — per-turn action economy.
- `!rest short|long` — restores appropriate features, slots, HP.
- `!level up` / `!level set <n>` — Gemini generates full mechanical level-up breakdown.

### Session Commands
- `!join` / `!leave` — voice channel management.
- `!setchannel` — sets the text channel for dice rolls and DM log.
- `!startsession` — generates a fresh opening narration.
- `!dm <text>` — manual text input to the DM (for players without mic).
- `!location <place>` — updates location in DM context.
- `!note <lore>` — adds a persistent world note.
- `!party` — shows all registered players and their status.
- `!gamehelp` — in-Discord command reference embed.

### Dice (DiceCog)
- `!roll <die>` — guided 3-prompt roll: dice count → advantage/disadvantage/normal → modifier. Posts embed to text channel. Each prompt shows `!resetroll to cancel`.
- `!resetroll` — cancels an in-progress roll at any step. Detected inside `wait_for` by checking if the message starts with `!resetroll` before parsing the input. Standalone command responds gracefully if no roll is active.
- `!stats` — 4d6 drop lowest × 6.

### End-of-Session DMs
- On `!stopcampaign`, each registered player receives a Discord DM with their character sheet: HP, race/class/level, inventory, known spells, remaining spell slots (visual bar), class feature uses, notes, and D&D Beyond link.

## Last Worked On

Added `!resetroll` to `DiceCog`:
- Each `wait_for` step in `!roll` now checks if the player typed `!resetroll` and exits early with "Roll cancelled."
- Each step prompt mentions `!resetroll to cancel`.
- Standalone `!resetroll` command responds gracefully when no roll is active.
- README, COMMANDS, and CLAUDE.md kept in sync with all changes.
